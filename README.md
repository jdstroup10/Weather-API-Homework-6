# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

![Screenshot of the Project](https://github.com/jdstroup10/Homework-6/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-01%20at%2011.52.57%20PM.png)

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## Notes 

This is the longest amount of time I've spent on any homework so far, but I don't have much progress to show for it. I was able to pull the present weather conditions from the openweather API based on the user's geolocation, but I ran into issues whenever I tried to add multi day forcasts based on user input. This homework ties in pretty closely with our project so I'm still going to be updating this as I hopfully get a better understanding of how API's work.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

The following image demonstrates the application functionality:
